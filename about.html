      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>
        Welcome to Lettuce Eat! We are current undergraduate students at the University of Washington, studying Computer Science. 
        This is a project completed for the  University of Washington course "Accessibility" (Fall 23').
      </p>
      <h1>Overview &amp; Motivation</h1>
      <p>
        Our team has built a web application that provides people with specific dietary restrictions the ability to create a custom diet filter 
        and find dining options at restaurants in the Seattle, WA U-District area. The application has pre-parsed dietary restrictions provided 
        but users are able to add any other filters that will meet their dietary needs. Additionally, we have a form that users can fill out to 
        submit data of specific restaurants not in our database. We have begun with a small number of restaurants in our database, hoping this 
        project would serve as a foundational step toward exploring efficient ways to parse menu information from the internet and organize 
        dietary data.
        <be><br>
          In our research, we found several first-hand accounts from individuals with food restrictions, including those who have celiac disease, 
          that demonstrate the obstacles they encounter when searching for restaurants that cater to their dietary needs. We believe that creating 
          technologies or providing resources, like our project, that share organized data on restaurant menus will help make the process of 
          finding suitable dining options easier.
